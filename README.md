- 👋 Hi, I’m @mcypert0725
- 👀 I’m interested in data, sql, java, python.
- 🌱 I am currently learning java, becoming better at python and applying tdd to my applications.  I try to learn as much as possible, but I have a full-time job as an actuary analyst which eats up a lot of my time.  I deal with a lot of data in my current role, which I enjoy tremendously.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on (not sure yet)
- 📫 How to reach me maybe some day I will put that here.
